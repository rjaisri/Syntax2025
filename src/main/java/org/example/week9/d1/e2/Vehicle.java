**Step 1: Create the `Vehicle` Class with a No-Argument Constructor**

1. **Create the `Vehicle.java` class** with the following:
    - **No-Argument Constructor:**
        - Define a constructor with no parameters.
        - Inside this constructor, include logic to print `"This is the Vehicle constructor"` to indicate that this constructor has been called.

   **Example Implementation (Explanation):**
    - The no-argument constructor is used to initialize the `Vehicle` class without needing any external data. It serves as the default behavior when no specific data is provided during object creation.

public class Vehicle {
    public Vehicle(){
        System.out.println("This is the Vehicle constructor");
    }}
